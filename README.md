# Jumbotron

## Overview

Jumbotron is a quick jQuery-based app to play goal horns whenever an NHL team scores a goal. Simply select the game you want to follow from the dropdown, minimize the window, forget it exists, and then jump out of your seat in shock when the horn goes off in 10 minutes.

## Limitations
* Can't host on HTTPS due to the JSONP feeds not being available.
* Vegas (understandably) and Buffalo (not understandably) don't have a goal horn yet
* Audio is only playing in Firefox, not Chrome.
